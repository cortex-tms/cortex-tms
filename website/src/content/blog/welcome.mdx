Welcome to the Cortex TMS blog! This is where we'll share insights, updates, and stories about building better software with AI agents. Whether you're shipping your first AI-powered project or scaling an entire platform with Claude Code, you're in the right place.

## What to Expect

We're here to help you navigate the new frontier of AI-assisted development. Here's what we'll be covering:

- **AI-Powered Development**: How to work effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot without losing control
- **Documentation Patterns**: Best practices for keeping documentation in sync with code as your project evolves
- **Project Governance**: Preventing "zero drift" and maintaining architectural consistency across teams
- **Real-World Case Studies**: How teams use Cortex TMS to ship faster with AI while maintaining quality

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Start">
New to Cortex TMS? Install it in seconds and set up governance docs:

```bash
npm install -g cortex-tms
cortex-tms init
cortex-tms validate --strict
```

Scaffold governance docs and validate their health.
</Callout>

## Coming Soon: Guardian

We're launching Guardian, an AI-powered code review tool that catches architectural violations before they reach production. It's like having a senior architect review every PR, but instant and pattern-aware.

<Terminal
  title="guardian-demo.sh"
  language="bash"
  content={`# Preview Guardian in safe mode
npx cortex-tms review src/ --safe

🛡️ Guardian: Semantic Validation
✓ Pattern compliance verified
✓ Safe Mode: No file operations executed
✓ 0 violations found

# Run Guardian validation
npx cortex-tms review src/commands/ --strict

📊 Analysis Complete
  ✓ 12 files scanned
  ✓ All patterns compliant
  ⚡ 0.8s execution time`}

Stay tuned for deep dives on:

1. **Preventing the "AI PR Tsunami" Problem** - How Guardian stops bad AI-generated code before merge
2. **Pattern-Based Code Review** - Why semantic patterns beat traditional linting
3. **Building with LLMs** - Lessons from shipping Guardian MVP in production

<Callout type="warning" title="Why This Matters">
AI assistants can generate code 10x faster, but without governance, you're building technical debt 10x faster too. Guardian ensures your AI-generated code follows your team's patterns from day one.
</Callout>

## The Challenge We're Solving

Modern AI tools are incredibly powerful and autonomous, but they can drift from your project standards. Without governance, AI reads:

- Old documentation that's no longer accurate
- Inconsistent patterns across files
- No record of architectural decisions
- No validation that docs stay current

Result? **Inconsistent code, pattern violations, overengineering.**

<Terminal
  language="typescript"
  content={`// Without governance docs
const result = await aiAgent.implement(feature)
// ❌ Uses different patterns each time
// ❌ No test coverage
// ❌ Overwrites project conventions

// With Cortex TMS validation
const result = await aiAgent.implement(feature)
// ✅ Follows PATTERNS.md
// ✅ Includes tests (CLAUDE.md requirement)
// ✅ Consistent with project standards`}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Governance Explained">
Cortex TMS uses a **tiered memory system** (HOT/WARM/COLD) to organize documentation:

- **HOT** (Active): Current work context - Always visible
- **WARM** (Truth): Patterns, architecture - Reference docs
- **COLD** (Archive): Historical content - Out of sight

Clear organization + validation = AI follows YOUR standards.
