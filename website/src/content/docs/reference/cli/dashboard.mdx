The `cortex-tms dashboard` command launches a full-screen interactive terminal UI showing real-time governance health for your TMS project — file tiers, staleness, sprint progress, validation status, and Guardian results in one place.

<DashboardPreview />

## Synopsis

```bash
cortex-tms dashboard [options]
```

## Description

The dashboard is built with **React + Ink** — it runs entirely in your terminal, no browser required. Navigate between three views using the `1`, `2`, `3` keys and quit with `q` or `Ctrl+C`.

<Aside type="tip" title="Live Mode">
Run `cortex-tms dashboard --live` to auto-refresh every 5 seconds — ideal for keeping a governance health pane open while you work.
</Aside>

---

## Options

### `--live`

Enable auto-refresh. The dashboard re-runs `collectTMSStats()` every 5 seconds and updates all cards.

```bash
cortex-tms dashboard --live
```

### `--cwd <path>`

Run the dashboard against a different project directory instead of the current working directory.

```bash
cortex-tms dashboard --cwd /path/to/project
```

## Views

Navigate with number keys:

| Key | View | What you see |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `1` | Overview | Governance score, staleness, sprint progress |
| `2` | Files | HOT files list, tier distribution, file size health |
| `3` | Health | Validation status, Guardian violations |
| `q` | — | Quit the dashboard |

## Cards

### Overview View

#### Governance Health Score
A composite 0–100 score calculated from validation status, Guardian results, and staleness data.

| Deduction | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| −40 pts | Validation errors |
| −20 pts | Validation warnings |
| −30 pts | Guardian major violations |
| −15 pts | Guardian minor issues |

Color coding: 🟢 green (80+) · 🟡 yellow (60–79) · 🔴 red (below 60)

#### Staleness Card
Shows git-based doc freshness when staleness detection is configured.

- **Stale docs** — count of docs flagged as outdated
- **Total checked** — how many governance docs were scanned
- **Freshness %** — percentage of docs still current
- **Oldest doc** — days since the least-recently-updated doc was touched

> Only shown when staleness data is available (requires full git history).

#### Sprint Progress Card
Reads your `NEXT-TASKS.md` sprint header and task markers:

- Sprint name and focus area
- Visual progress bar
- Done / In Progress / Todo task counts

Shows a "Not Configured" card if no sprint is detected in `NEXT-TASKS.md`.

---

### Files View

#### HOT Files Card
Lists all files currently tagged as HOT tier — the files your AI agents will always read.

#### File Distribution Card
Bar chart breakdown of HOT / WARM / COLD file counts across your project.

#### File Size Health Card
Highlights any docs that are approaching or exceeding line limits (Rule 4). Only shown when oversized files are detected.

---

### Health View

#### Validation Card
Mirrors the output of `cortex-tms validate`:

- **Status** — Healthy / Warnings / Errors / Unknown
- **Violation count** — number of issues found
- **Last checked** — relative timestamp of last validation run

#### Guardian Status Card
Shows the result of the last `cortex-tms review` run:

- **Status** — No violations / Minor issues / Major violations / Unknown
- **Total violations** — full count
- **High-confidence violations** — filtered to ≥70% confidence
- **Last checked** — relative timestamp

  <TabItem label="One-shot">
```bash
# Open the dashboard and browse manually
cortex-tms dashboard
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Live mode">
```bash
# Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
cortex-tms dashboard --live
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Different project">
```bash
# Dashboard for a project in another directory
cortex-tms dashboard --cwd ~/projects/my-api
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Switch to Overview view |
| `2` | Switch to Files view |
| `3` | Switch to Health view |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit |

## How It Works

The dashboard calls the same `collectTMSStats()` pipeline used by `cortex-tms validate` and `cortex-tms status`. All data is read from:

- `.cortexrc` — project configuration
- `NEXT-TASKS.md` — sprint detection
- Git history — staleness detection (requires `fetch-depth: 0` in CI)
- Last validation/review results — validation and Guardian cards

No external API calls are made. All data is local.
