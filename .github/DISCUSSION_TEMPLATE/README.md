# Discussion Templates

These templates help community members create well-formatted discussions.

## Available Templates

- **`ideas.yml`** - For feature requests and improvement suggestions
- **`question.yml`** - For asking questions to the community
- **`show-and-tell.yml`** - For showcasing projects built with Cortex TMS

## How Templates Work

When users create a new discussion in specific categories, they'll be guided through a structured form that helps them provide all necessary context.

## Customization

Templates use GitHub's form schema format. Learn more:
